Well, as you may know we are doing some switches and stuff but i didn't say for what, we are making this treeview in the bottom frame and this going to work as a filter searcher. We aren't doing this now but the main thing its that as you can see in the next code, there are a search (busqueda) button that displays that stuff, i wanna have another button to filter the results in the treeview in the next way:

There are switches, then we turn on or off depending which results we want and then another button to refresh the treeview.

Dont do this now, im just saying so we can do this later on
